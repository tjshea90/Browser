# CHECKPOINT 710 — read me first, then TASKS.md

**Written:** 2026-11-12T02:20:56Z · **tests:** 1 RED: test_handoff.sh (0 green)
**Branch:** `ccr-a57c163e-mtq8js` · **builds on:** `6ab16b5` (this checkpoint is the commit after it)

## Just done
pre-ship: alpha16: daily update dialog (app, engine, ad-block lists) with Update button, ad-block lists refresh every day, download manager survives kills/outages/refused connections and starts faster, Network lab switches, Page loads timing in Diagnostics

## Do this next
ship.sh gates and releases this (gecko)

*(resuming? CLAUDE.md's "FIRST ACTION OF EVERY SESSION" says how; the briefing is tools/resume.sh. Do that first, or autosave may stay off all session.)*

## Uncommitted right now
     M geckoapp/build.gradle.kts

## Last ten checkpoints
